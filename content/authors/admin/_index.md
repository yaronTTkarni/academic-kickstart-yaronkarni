My romance with posts was started on 2007, but after some years i stopped updating the site, during the time, I used excellent pages like https://stackoverflow.com/, https://www.baeldung.com/ and so forth, but i found myself most of the time with lack of e2e solution, or the description was too short or kind of summary.

The idea of this site, First, to share with you my archtieture & design knowledge, assemble things together and make vision alive, i am not going to replace https://stackoverflow.com/ but i adhere to cover aspects that i deal with e2e.

If you have comments, insight, share with me, email to yaron.karni@gmail.com and i will be glad to assist.
